// Not every key and value for an event is necessary. If you add your own events, this is what's needed:
// event name, perpetrator, victim <- All events
// infected player (optional, for events like tongue_pull_stopped that have it)

// Some event triggers require mandatory events:
// ability_use is required for abilities triggered by "A"
// player_spawn is required for abilities triggered by "a"
