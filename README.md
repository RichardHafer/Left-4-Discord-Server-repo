# Left-4-Discord-Server-repo
Source- and Metamod plugins used on our Left 4 Dead 2 Dedicated server. Public repository

**LINUX SERVERS ONLY**

**DISCLAIMER: Keep in mind that our server runs the newest Left 4 Dead 2 version and SourceMod 1.11!
If used for other versions, beware that it might be unstable or not work at all!**

Requirements:

Clean Servers:
Sourcemod (1.11), Metamod (Optional is Stripper:Source but required for 8+ player server)
Extensions, Gamedata, Main Competitive Plugins, etc
These simple Steps also setup your Server's base for other configs, so you'll only need the optional plugins that other configs require.
Competitive Servers:
None, modify your matchmodes file to add the config to the Match menu and you're set. :)
