# Left-4-Discord-Server-repo
Source- and Metamod plugins used on our Left 4 Dead 2 Dedicated server. Public repository.
I created this repo to share and help people who want to set up servers similar to ours, usually 8 player coop or 8+ player versus servers, however, don't expect this repo to always be up-to-date with newest plugin versions and files

# **DISCLAIMER DON'T IGNORE THIS!** 
**- Many Plugins have been edited to have [Left 4 Discord] prefix in chat, however, I was not able to include most edited files in the "addons/sourcemod/scripting" folder, as they still are on my old Computer or I deleted them entirely**

**- Plugins in the "optional" or "disabled" folder are disabled automatically. Plugin can only be activated with the command: 
"sm plugins load optional/pluginnamehere.smx" 
or
"sm plugins load disabled/pluginnamehere.smx"**

**- There are a lot of unused configs or text files in "cfg/sourcemod", "addons/sourcemod/data" and "addons/sourcemod/configs" because I tested and used a lot of different plugins in the past and I did not delete them so my settings can be saved, as I may activate a plugin again in the future**

**- Server currently set at maximum of 16 players, can be up to 32 however**

**- Linux servers only?**
I can not verify if everything will work fine on Windows.
If used on other game versions or operating-systems, beware that it might be unstable or not work at all.
